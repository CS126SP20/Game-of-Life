# [Game of Life]

### Project Overview
  For my final project, I would like to create a version of John Conway's Game of Life. This concept is a cellular automaton that was first created by John Conway. The game models how cells interact with one another, living or dying based on its location on the grid and interaction with neighboring cells. In my project, I would like to successfully model the cells data and have a working graphic of the evolution and interaction of the cells. 
### Background knowledge
  I recently heard about this game as its creator, John Conway, recently passed away due to Covid-19. His work remains revolutionary and is continued to be researched on and expanded. The automaton of the cells is based on rules that Conway discovered that would bring the game to life. The interaction of the cells is dependent on their location in the grid and can be explaining in three base rules:
  1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
  2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
  3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

  I want to work on this project because of how interested I am not only in John Conway's works but also Alan Turing's whose research layed foundations to this concept. Further, I would like to learn more about modeling and graphing biological data with programs which I can focus on through this project. 
### External Libraries
  One external library I am thinking of using is JSON https://github.com/nlohmann/json for various aspects of the project. The initial configuraiton of the cells on the grid is integral to the movement of the cells, so I would like to use JSON to store data on the pattern and coordinates of the starting cells. I would also like to use SQLite https://www.sqlite.org/index.html in a similar fashion to store data throughout the project in an organized manner.
### Timeline
  By the end of week one I would like to have set up my environment and make sure I am able to work with my libraries in the way I expected. Further, I would like to set up the intial grid and matricies of the automaton and complete the initial configuration of the starting cells. Week 2 I will focusing on finishing the main logic of the cells' interaction and set up the GUI to display the movement of the cells. In week 3 I would like to finish up any remaining parts of the logic behind the cells' interaction and focus on the display and accuracy of the information. 
### Stretch Goals
  If I finished the project early there is an extensions I would consider adding to the game. I would focus on adding more possible intitial configurations of the cells to model different movement and evolution of the cells. In this there would be new interactions within the cell that can be displayed. Further if I finished early, I would focus more on the visual component of the project and making it as user-friendly as possible.
